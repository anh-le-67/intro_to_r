2. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF SYMBOLS

Definitions:

Age
For the annual figures, we use the age at the end of each month. This is the number of full years that have passes on the last day of the month since the date of birth of a person. A person can contribute to two different age classes a year.

Employee
Someone  who has a contract with an economic unit to carry out work in return for financial remuneration. 

Employment
An umbrella concept for the filled and unfilled demand for work by employees and self-employed people. Several related concepts are jobs, (filled and unfilled vacancies), employed people, employed labour force and labour volume. This table comprises the jobs of employees.

Job 
This table is about jobs of employees, and not about jobs of self-employed people. It is about economic units residing in the Netherlands. The employee is not necessarily a resident of the Netherlands.

Overtime
With additional premium paid extra hours worked, i.e. in addition to the normal working hours. Extra activities which are compensated with free time or otherwise not paid are not considered overtime.

Reduced working hours (ADV)
Reduction in working hours on a weekly or yearly basis as a result of an agreement on shorter working hours. 

Size of company
Classification of companies based on the number of employed persons. 

Standard Industrial Classification 2008 (SIC 2008)
The Dutch hierarchic classification of economic activities is used by Statistics Netherlands to classify entities by main activity. The SIC 2008 is the version used since 2008.
“Sector of industry” or “branch” is the common term used to define businesses sharing the same main activity. 

Type of employment contract
Breakdown of jobs into full-time and part-time jobs.

Working hours
The work and pay agreed between the employer and employee is expressed in hours per period. There is a distinction between weekly and yearly working hours. Weekly working hours are calculated by the average hours per year for a paid job divided by 52. The hours paid include hours leave, paid overtime, paid sick and study leave, but exclude reduction of working hours (ADV). Statistics Netherlands also determines the weekly working hours without overtime. 
The yearly working hours of a job are the average hours paid in a year excluding overtime hours and leave hours for vacations, reduction of working hours (ADV) and official holidays. The yearly average of the yearly working hours per year of employment are determined per year of employment instead of per job.

The figures on yearly wages including bonuses, yearly wages excluding bonuses, bonuses and additional tax liability for the company car are rounded of to the nearest 10. So the sum of the individual categories may not always add up to total.

4. SOURCES AND METHODS

The source for the employment figures is the Policy Record Administration (also called ‘Netherlands Labour and Benefit Database’). This source comes from the UWV, the organisation responsible for the implementation of social insurance and benefits. It is based on the complete wage tax registration of the tax authorities. The Policy Record Administration is the direct or indirect source for a number of statistics, such as the number of employee jobs in the Netherlands plus their corresponding characteristics. The method with which the Policy Record Administration delineates jobs was changed in 2011. This change is carried through, because a study revealed that about 1% of the total number of jobs is not included in the selection of jobs from the source data. These jobs are included in the new method. These extra jobs are more or less equally divided among the sectors of industry. Most are jobs without employee insurance; about one third are director-major shareholders with their own company. Statistics Netherlands uses this new population of jobs. Year 2010 is presented twice: once with the old and once with the new job population from 2011 on. The years 2006-2009 are based on the old job population.  

In January 2010 Statistics Netherlands changed the setup of enterprise groups. This affects a limited number of enterprises and institutions. At the same time the number of employees and the size class of the businesses derived from it in the General Business Register of Statistics Netherlands changed to being based on individual data from the Policy Record Administration of the Employee Insurance Agency (UWV). These changes may lead to differences in the coding according to the Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities (SIC2008) and/or the size class of a business or enterprise group. In some cases this may have consequences for the statistical results, especially for the results per branch/sector or size class.

The job industry is taken from the General Business Register (ABR) of Statistics Netherlands. The ABR lists company details arranged by business unit. Up until the end of 2014, some corrections were made during the processing of Policy Records. Most of these corrections were related to SBI (Standard Industrial Classification) 64200, referring to Financial institutions. In cases where the business type code listed in Policy Records was different from the SBI 64200, this SBI was recoded into a code more in line with the sector code. Since 2014, such recoding is no longer applied. The break which occurs as a result can be seen when selecting ‘Financial services’ and in most cases applies to Directors/Major shareholders.

For the year 2017 the method for calculation of the part-time factor is improved. As a result, the number of full-time employees decreases whereas the number of part-time employees increases. In business types with many part-timers, such as health care, this resulted in a break in type of employment contract.
